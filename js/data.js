Electroencephalography (EEG) recordings show sleep spindles — bursts of rhythmic brain wave activity — and K-complexes, or brief, high-amplitude waves. <br/>I chose these colors to convey a sense of warmth, relaxation, and transition.These colors can symbolize calmness and reduced activity, aligning with the gradual relaxation of muscles in Stage 2.'

        'description': 'Stage 3, also known as slow-wave sleep, is the deepest stage of NREM sleep. During this stage, delta waves emerge, and the brain is less responsive to external stimuli. It is difficult to wake the sleeping person. Our brain activity throughout these stages is gradually slowing down so that by deep sleep, we experience nothing but delta brain waves, the slowest brain waves (see sidebar).<br/>The transition to deep sleep is associated with reduced brain activity and sensory responsiveness.The gentle blending of pink and pale hues symbolize this shift into a state of minimal external awareness.'

        'description': 'After stage 3, about 90 minutes after we go to sleep, we begin rapid eye movement sleep (REM sleep). REM sleep is primarily characterized by movements of the eyes and is the fourth stage of sleep. Other mammals, birds and reptiles exhibit REM sleep, too.<br/>Blue is often associated with the subconscious, dreams, and introspection.Since REM sleep is when vivid dreaming occurs, these shades might symbolize the surreal and immersive nature of dreams.'
